# Investigating Movies Dataset

## by Samuel Tsuma


## Introduction

This project provides an analysis of data collected from a movie database. 
We will specifically look at trends in the movies that had low production 
cost and how they differed from those that had medium and high production 
cost. We will also rate how the movies did (as Bad, Good or Great) based 
on the average votes (vote_average) and analyse trends and interelation 
between these categorical variables and other independent variables.

## Summary of Findings

Medium-budget movies appeared to have made the highest mean profits,
vote counts, popularity and average votes. High-budget films had median
means of the three budget categories and Low-budget movies recorded the
lowest means in each of the 4 variables. It is safe to conclude that 
there are relations between the four analyzed variables. Higher vote 
counts means more people watched a movie and voted. More people watching
a movie could mean increased popularity which could mean higher ratings


Steven Spielberg's movies in the years 2010 to 2015 have the highest mean 
profits, median vote count, and median popularity. Shawn Levy's rank in 
second in mean profits, highest mean vote counts and highest mean popularity 
while Steven Soderbergh's ranking the least in all three variables. 
Based on the findings, relations between the vote counts and popularity are 
just like those in the first analysis.
